# Model Deployment Lab

The `Text Extraction and Analyzer` project addresses the challenge of manually sifting through textual sources to extract job-related information. By automating the process, it eliminates the need for time-consuming searches and utilizes NLP for comprehensive analysis. This tool streamlines the identification and extraction process, providing users with a concise summary of job vacancies and facilitating informed decision-making.

# Architecture
In the design phase, the `Text Extraction and Analyzer` project focuses on creating a robust and user-centric solution. The system architecture is modular and scalable, accommodating diverse sources of textual information. The user interface allows for seamless uploading of image files through drag and drop functionality.
